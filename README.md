# Plane Force System Optimizer (PFO)

## üìå Introduction
The **Plane Force System Optimizer (PFO)** is a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the **principles of theoretical mechanics**.  
It models optimization as a system of **planar force interactions**, where candidate solutions are treated as objects influenced by different categories of force systems.  
By mapping optimization processes to mechanics concepts, PFO provides a balance between **exploration** (global search) and **exploitation** (local refinement).

This repository provides the **implementation, benchmark experiments, and usage examples** of PFO.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Overview
PFO is based on the **plane force system principle**, where multiple forces interact on candidate solutions:

- **Single-force systems** ‚Üí direct optimization pressure.  
- **Two-force systems** ‚Üí balance of attraction/repulsion.  
- **Concurrent force systems** ‚Üí multi-directional search capability.  
- **Parallel force systems** ‚Üí stability and refinement in exploitation.  

The algorithm iteratively updates positions of individuals according to **resultant force vectors**, allowing efficient convergence toward the global optimum.
